About:

* The group won third place champion

Introduction:
* The program allows one to define which previously received emails are considered spam and which are not.
* Once a specified number of emails are categorized, one may enter the subject line of an unseen email, and the program will define this new email as "spam" or "not spam."
* The larger the number of categorized emails, the more accurate the filter.
